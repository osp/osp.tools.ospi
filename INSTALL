ospi - INSTALL

ospi is written in C++, in order to compile it, you will need a working toolchain and a c++ compiler.

ospi depends on:
PoDoFo <http://podofo.sourceforge.net/>
Boost <http://www.boost.org/>

ospi can make use of:
libcurl <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>
gmplib <http://gmplib.org/>


We use CMake <http://www.cmake.org/> to build and install ospi.


It's recommended to build the program outside the source tree, in order to facilitate source code versioning management.

*INSTALL on Linux/UNIX

If you run a Debian system, or derivative, first ensure the dependencies are there:
$ sudo aptitude install cmake
$ sudo aptitude install libboost-all-dev
$ sudo aptitude install libgmp3-dev

Unfortunately podofo has no Ubuntu 10.4 packages (and they recommend compiling anyways), so you'll need to follow the convoluated (?) compilations: http://podofo.sourceforge.net/.
But to help with dependencies install this first:
$ sudo aptitude install libzlib libfreetype6-dev fontconfig libjpeg-dev libtiff-dev libpng3-dev


First move to the root of ospi directory
$ cd /WHERE/IS/OSPI

Create a build directory
$ mkdir build

and move into it
$ cd build

Run CMake to generate the makefiles
$ cmake ../

Then compile the program
$ make

The program is now under ./src/ directory with the name ospi. You can run it from here just by typing "./src/ospi"
If you want to install it, instruct make to do it
$ make install


*INSTALL on Mac OS X

To make it easier to install the dpendencies, you can use a package manager like Homebrew.
First ensure the dependencies are there:
$ brew install cmake
$ brew install boost
$ brew install podofo
$ brew install gmp

If you run into build issues, you may need to run this first:
$ brew update
$ brew doctor

Then the same as for Linux/UNIX. With the option to generate an XCode project.

*INSTALL on Windows
