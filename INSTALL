ospi - INSTALL

ospi is written in C++, in order to compile it, you will need a working toolchain and a c++ compiler.

ospi depends on:
PoDoFo <http://podofo.sourceforge.net/>
Boost <http://www.boost.org/>

ospi can make use of:
libcurl <http://curl.haxx.se/libcurl/>
gmplib <http://gmplib.org/>


We use CMake <http://www.cmake.org/> to build and install ospi.


It's recommended to build the program outside the source tree, in order to facilitate source code versioning management.

*INSTALL on Linux/UNIX

First move to the root of ospi directory
$ cd /WHERE/IS/OSPI

Create a build directory
$ mkdir build

and move into it
$ cd build

Run CMake to generate the makefiles
$ cmake ../

Then compile the program
$ make

The program is now under ./src/ directory with the name ospi. You can run it from here just by typing "./src/ospi"
If you want to install it, instruct make to do it
$ make install


*INSTALL on Mac OS X

The same as for Linux/UNIX. With the option to generate an XCode project.

*INSTALL on Windows
